# NUU Sync Development History

## Session: Major UI Overhaul and Bug Fixes

### Problems Fixed:
1. **Authentication not working** - "Invalid password" error when trying to sign up
2. **White screen when opening documents** - React markdown dependencies causing crashes
3. **Color theme issues** - Too many colors, needed black and white only
4. **Login page spacing and branding** - Logo was too complex, spacing was off
5. **Authentication still failing** - Password validation required 8+ characters
6. **White screen persisting** - HTML manipulation breaking rendering

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. Fixed Authentication
- Removed complex Password provider configuration in `convex/auth.ts` - simplified to just `Password` without custom profile
- Added JWT_PRIVATE_KEY to `.env.local` for password authentication support
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `convex/comments.ts` by properly typing userId as `Id<"users">`
- Added proper error logging in SignInForm to debug auth issues

#### 2. Fixed White Screen Issue
- Removed problematic React Markdown dependencies that were causing crashes
- Rewrote `MarkdownRenderer.tsx` with simple regex-based markdown parsing
- Removed syntax highlighting and other complex features that were breaking
- Simplified highlight implementation to use basic HTML spans

#### 3. Simplified Color Theme to Black & White
- Updated all CSS variables to use only grays, black, and white
- Removed all blue, green, purple, pink color classes
- Changed all buttons to use black backgrounds with white text
- Updated avatars to use black background instead of gradients
- Simplified all UI components to monochrome design

#### 4. Fixed Login Page
- Simplified logo to just "NUU Sync" text - removed icon and gradient text
- Fixed spacing on login form with proper gap-4 between inputs
- Changed "Sign up instead" button to black text (was using undefined primary color)
- Reduced login container width to max-w-sm for better proportions
- Simplified tagline to "Deep reading, together"

#### 5. Additional UI Improvements
- Removed stats cards from document list
- Simplified header to plain white with bottom border
- Removed all gradient effects and shadows
- Made all cards use simple borders instead of shadows
- Fixed comment sidebar to use black avatars
- Simplified highlight colors to just yellow

### Code Changes Summary:
- `src/index.css` - Complete overhaul to black/white theme
- `src/App.tsx` - Simplified header and login page layout
- `src/SignInForm.tsx` - Fixed form spacing and button colors
- `src/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx` - Complete rewrite without dependencies
- `src/components/CommentSidebar.tsx` - Updated to monochrome design
- `src/components/DocumentList.tsx` - Removed stats, simplified cards
- `convex/auth.ts` - Simplified Password provider setup
- `convex/comments.ts` - Fixed TypeScript errors with proper types
- `.env.local` - Added JWT_PRIVATE_KEY for auth

#### 6. Final Fixes for Auth and White Screen
- Added password minimum length (8 characters) to SignInForm input field
- Updated error messages to clearly indicate password requirements for sign up
- Removed broken `applyHighlights` function that was manipulating HTML strings
- Simplified `renderMarkdown` to use line-by-line processing with inline styles
- Fixed TypeScript error by importing `Id` type in comments.ts

### Result:
Clean, minimalist black and white interface with working authentication and no white screen crashes. The app now has a professional, distraction-free design focused on the reading experience. Users must use passwords of 8+ characters when signing up.

## Session: Final Debugging and Polish (Current)

### Issues Addressed:
1. **Persistent authentication failures** - Users still getting "Invalid password" when signing up
2. **White screen still occurring** - Documents showing briefly then going white

### Final Solutions:

#### Authentication Requirements Clarified
- Password validation now enforces 8+ character minimum with clear UI feedback
- Added `minLength={8}` attribute to password input
- Improved error messages to distinguish between sign-up password requirements vs login failures
- Updated placeholder text to indicate "Password (min 8 characters)"

#### White Screen Root Cause Fixed
- **Issue**: Complex HTML string manipulation in `applyHighlights()` function was breaking DOM rendering
- **Solution**: Completely removed the highlight overlay system temporarily to ensure stable document viewing
- **Rendering**: Rewrote `renderMarkdown()` to use line-by-line processing with inline styles instead of CSS classes
- **Stability**: Eliminated all `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` manipulation after initial render

#### Technical Improvements
- Fixed missing TypeScript import (`Id` type) in `convex/comments.ts`
- All linting errors resolved - TypeScript compilation passes
- Build process completes successfully
- Removed dependency on Tailwind prose classes that were causing conflicts

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Authentication works with 8+ character passwords
- ‚úÖ Documents render without white screen crashes
- ‚úÖ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ‚úÖ Clean black and white UI theme maintained
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Highlighting feature temporarily disabled for stability

### Next Steps (if needed):
- Re-implement highlighting system using React refs instead of HTML string manipulation
- Add comment threading back with proper DOM event handling
- Consider using a proper markdown library with better error handling
