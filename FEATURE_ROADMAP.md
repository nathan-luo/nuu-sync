3. ‚úÖ Proper async/await error handling
4. ‚úÖ ESLint compliance across all components
5. ‚úÖ Performance optimizations (useCallback, proper dependencies)

### Remaining Immediate Fixes
1. Update CLAUDE.md (mentions React+Vite but using Next.js)
2. Implement comprehensive error boundaries
3. Add unit and integration tests
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Long-term Improvements
1. Migrate to more scalable architecture if needed
2. Implement proper logging and monitoring
3. Add A/B testing framework

5. Create design system documentation

## Success Metrics
- User engagement (DAU/MAU)
- Document creation rate
- Comment activity
- Sharing frequency
- User retention
- Performance metrics (load times, etc.)

## Risk Mitigation
1. ‚úÖ **Highlighting stability**: Successfully redesigned with stable overlay system
2. **Performance at scale**: Plan for horizontal scaling early
3. ‚úÖ **User adoption**: Core features (highlighting, sharing, editing) now complete
4. **Technical debt**: Continue allocating 20% time for refactoring

## Prioritization Notes
